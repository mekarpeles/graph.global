===

The World Wide Graph (w2g) is yet another attempt at an open (no auth
to read) RDF style entity graph (people, places) for cross-domain,
entity resolved semantic #tagging. It consists of a database which is
accessible restfully at http://graph.global, as well as (soon) a
javascript client and python client library for implementing semantic
tags in your website or through serverside applications.
